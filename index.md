# Example Student Portfolio

Congrats on finding my portfolio!

This site is a simple portfolio template for me to showcase my work, 
projects, and interests. 

One of my favorite projects is a [* insert game here *](./html/dino.html).

In my free time, I also enjoy online games. If you're ever up for a game of [chess](./html/focaccia.html). send me a friend request and we can set up a game. You'll end up losing, of course, but it'll be fun nevertheless. Or, if you wanna play Marvel Rivals together, my username is DM4027.
