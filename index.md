# Example Student Portfolio

Congrats on finding my portfolio!

Follow along online with our [Zoom Session for the Tuesday 1 April Class.](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89801627815?pwd=50OLJZQrdI3hsAsckgiUSlKeWFncLl.1) 

This site is a simple portfolio template for me to showcase my work, 
projects, and interests. 

One of my favorite projects is a [simple dino jump game I
created](./html/dino.html). It's a browser-based game where a pixelated dinosaur
leaps over obstacles to score points. While the concept is straightforward, I
enjoyed the challenge of implementing smooth animations and responsive controls.
It was a fun way to practice JavaScript and game design principles.

In my free time, I also enjoy baking, and my favorite recipe is for [homemade
focaccia](./html/focaccia.html). The process of kneading the dough and infusing it with olive oil,
rosemary, and sea salt is incredibly satisfying. The result is a golden, fluffy
bread that's perfect for sharing with friends or enjoying as a snack.
